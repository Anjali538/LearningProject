		Does lambda support recursive invocation? —— https://www.java2novice.com/java_interview_questions/java-8-lambda-recursive-support/
		Are java lambdas closures. Can they define variables with same name as in enclosing method? - https://dzone.com/articles/java-8-lambas-limitations-closures
		What are the cases when you cannot replace a lambda expression with a method reference? - https://dzone.com/articles/method-references-cannot-always-replace-lambda-expressions — if method signature differ lama can use but method reference can show compiler error.
		Can you use statements like break, continue in lambda - takeWhile we can use instead of brake in java  and filter can be used as continue
		Convert a list into sorted set using lambda expression - Code
		Calculate average in an array list - Code
		If I have list of movies with ratings and year of release. I want to first sort them based on ratings and then year of release - Code
		Streams operations
		How can you re-use a stream - https://mkyong.com/java8/java-stream-has-already-been-operated-upon-or-closed/
		What are intermediate and terminal operations? Which operations are lazy evaluated?https://www.knowledgepowerhouse.com/what-are-the-differences-between-intermediate-and-terminal-operations-in-java-8-streams/514
		Is a parallel stream always good if I have a multi-core? How do you decide to go for parallel stream? How does parallel stream internally work? How do you configure the thread     pool used by the parallel streams?

		How SplitIterators work?
		Write a program to count the number of ‘e’ in a list. E.g "Ken", "Jeff", "Ellen" should print 4. - Code
		I have a stream of strings and I want to collect them in  a map with key as length and value as a Set of those words - Code
		Functional Interface and Functional programming with Lambda  --- https://www.tothenew.com/blog/functional-programming-in-java8-using-lambda-expressions/
		Why Functional interfaces - https://www.journaldev.com/2763/java-8-functional-interfaces
		Why default interfaces - 
		Wht sytic methods allowed in interfaces?
		If an interface has 3 methods, one abstract another default and also a toString() method, will it be a functional interface? What is the purpose of using @Functionalinterface?
		What is the difference between a Predicate and a Function?
		Ans --- Both helps in evaluating lambda expressions. 
		The difference is a predicate takes one argument and returns a boolean value while a function takes one argument and returns an object.
		Create an Apple class which has got an id and weight of an apple. From a list of Apples find out apples which are less than 250 gms but more than 150 gms - Code
		Create an ArrayList with Strings in lower case. Convert the entire list into upper case?
